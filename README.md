# Groupie Trackers Search Bar

## Description

`search-bar` is a project based off groupie tracker that involves receiving a given API and manipulating the data contained in it to create a website that displays the information. The API consists of four parts:

1. **Artists**: Information about bands and artists, including their names, images, the year they began their activity, the date of their first album, and their members.
2. **Locations**: Details of their last and/or upcoming concert locations.
3. **Dates**: Information about their last and/or upcoming concert dates.
4. **Relation**: Links between artists, dates, and locations.

This program is primarily written in Go for server-side logic, utilizing HTML templates and CSS stylesheets to visually enhance the website and provide a user-friendly interface.

`Groupie tracker` is a web application that displays information about bands, their members, concert performance locations and their respective dates. It reads information from a provided `API(application programming interface)` which basically gets requests from end users and provide feedback by reading from the database on a web server, and displaying the information on a web user-interface.
